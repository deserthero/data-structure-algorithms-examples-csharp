        // Scenarios:
        //
        // When you hear a problem beginning with the following statements, it's often (though not always) a good
        // candidate for recursion: "Design an algorithm to compute the nth .. :; "Write code to list the first n.. :; "Implement
        // a method to compute all..:; and so on.


        // Recursion Vs. iteration (Recursion is inefficient in space domains):
        //
        // Recursive algorithms can be very space inefficient.Each recursive call adds a new layer to the stack, which
        // means that if your algorithm recurses to a depth of n, it uses at least O(n) memory.
        //For this reason, it's often better to implement a recursive algorithm iteratively. All recursive algorithms can
        //be implemented iteratively, although sometimes the code to do so is much more complex.Before diving
        //into recursive code, ask yourself how hard it would be to implement it iteratively, and discuss the tradeoffs
        //with your interviewer.
